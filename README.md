# vim-config
My personal vim configuration.

Before running `:plugInstall` make sure you have [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) in your `autoload` dirrectory.

### Additional dependencies:
- [Gvim fullscreen dll (windows only)](https://github.com/derekmcloughlin/gvimfullscreen_win32)


### Personal Preference:
- [Dina font](https://www.donationcoder.com/Software/Jibz/Dina/)
- [Codeschool theme](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes/blob/master/colors/codeschool.vim). 

Make sure you update vimrc with the new font/theme.
